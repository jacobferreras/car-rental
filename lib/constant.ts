    question: "Why do you require proof of insurance?",
    answer:
      "Proof of insurance is required to protect both you and our company from financial risk. Your personal auto insurance acts as the primary coverage for the vehicle in case of damage, theft, or an accident. It ensures all parties are protected and helps facilitate a smoother claims process if an incident occurs.",

    answer:
      "We pride ourselves on transparency. All fees and charges will be clearly communicated during the booking process. There are no hidden fees, so you can rent with confidence.",
